This program was written to solve a specific problem:
I want to use Anki to memorise Japanese song lyrics and become a karaoke god.

Anki cards will have one lyric line on the front, the next line on the back.
A song may have repeated lyrics, these are deduplicated and removed.
A song may also have cases where the front lyric is the same with a different back lyric, e.g., going from the last line of the chorus to the 2nd, 3rd etc verse. These cases are also accounted for and disambiguated with a number.

Next step: tokenising and adding furigana with mecab.
